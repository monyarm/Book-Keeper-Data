      "description": "Beedle's stories resemble Muggle fairy tales in many respects; for instance, virtue is usually rewarded and wickedness punished. However, there is one very obvious difference. In Muggle fairy tales, magic tends to lie at the root of the hero or heroine's troubles — the wicked witch has poisoned the apple, put the princess into a hundred years' sleep or turned the prince into a hideous beast.\r\n\r\n        In The Tales of Beedle the Bard, on the other hand, we meet heroes and heroines who can perform magic themselves, and yet find it just as hard to solve their problems as the Muggle heroes do.Beedle 's stories have helped generations of wizarding parents to explain this painful fact of life to their young children: that magic causes as much trouble as it cures.\r\n\r\n            Another notable difference between these fables and their Muggle counterparts is that Beedle 's witches are much more active in seeking their fortunes than our fairy-tale heroines. Asha, Altheda, Amata and Babbitty Rabbity are all witches who take their fate into their own hands, rather than a prolonged nap or waiting for someone to return a lost shoe. The exception to this rule — the unnamed maiden of '\r\n        The Warlock 's Hairy Heart'—\r\n        acts more like a Muggle 's idea of a storybook princess, but there is no happily ever after at the end of her tale.\r\n\r\n        Most of these tales(with the exception of The Warlock 's Hairy Heart) have been rewritten by Beatrix Bloxam and compiled into her book The Toadstool Tales; which has since been banned since it had a tendency to induce nausea and vomiting in the children who read, or had to listen to, them. \r\nOne story by Beedle is \"The Tale of the Three Brothers \". This story was about brothers who meet Death on the road and avoid his clutches; each in turn receives a gift from him, although Death attempts to twist each boon into a bane. "

      "description": "The Toadstool Tales were a series of adaptations of other works, written by Beatrix Bloxam. They contained soppy, \"sanitised\" versions of other works, including The Tales of Beedle the Bard , which was Mrs Bloxam's way of purifying them so as to preserve children's innocence. Beatrix Bloxam set out to write The Toadstool Tales because of the \"unwholesome characters\" and themes found in The Tales of Beedle the Bard that she believed were damaging to children. Among these adaptations were a \"pure and precious\" reworking of \"The Wizard and the Hopping Pot\", the last paragraph of which contains nausea-inducing nonsense about \"Wee Willykins\" curing his \"dollies\" of their \"poorly tum-tums\", and then giving them sweeties, reminding them to brush their \"teethy-pegs\", and promising to help the dollies and no longer be an \"old grumpy-wumpkins\".

      "description": "Chapter I - Animal, Vegetable, Horklump or Gnome?\n\nA Horklump can be overcome by casting Flipendo to retract its spikes and then pulling it out of the ground. During my myriad travels across this magical globe of ours, I have beheld many strange sights and encountered a veritable bestiary of peculiar and exotic creatures. The vast majority of creatures I have had the misfortune to encounter have been of a decidedly threatening variety – not so the Horklump, which is similar to a large, bristly toadstool and is actually an animal rather than a plant. I well remember the time when, during a particularly satisfying sojourn with some fans of mine in the wilds of Essex, I offered to clear a pathway in their quaint, suburban yard (I quail from terming this square of scrub and turf a 'garden'), which had been ubiquitously blocked by several Horklumps. The usual technique for Horklumps is to hit them with a Knockback Jinx then, taking a good firm hold on them, twist and yank them from the ground. Needless to say, when I had cleared the pathway of every last Horklump, my fans were more than grateful and rewarded me with several bottles of their home-brewed Celery and Beetroot Wine – which, of course, I promptly declined.\n\nGnomes are rather more threatening than the inert and somewhat tedious Horklump. These little pests are endemic to even the most well-tended garden – like my own, for example, which stretches to eight, well-manicured acres. A rather common way to deal with garden gnomes is to grab them as they pop up from their burrows, and spin them in a circle. After doing so, keep spinning them (make sure that they are well away from your hair) above your head and then launch them as far as possible. However, I have found that the most efficient way of dealing with this potato-headed garden blight is to Flipendo the little blighter, grab him by the legs and fling him over a low wall or hedgerow – preferably not into your neighbour’s smaller and less cared for garden! One must be careful of the gnome's tiny, yet razor-sharp teeth, but a well-targeted Flipendo Knockback Jinx will deal with them most assuredly.\nChapter II - Of Impish Idiosyncrasies\n\nTo dispose of an Imp, Flipendo it then pick it up and drop in the nearest cage, hole or bottomless pit. I well remember the time when, on a particularly dangerous trek along the banks of the River Clyde in Glasgow, Scotland, in search of the fabled 'Weetimorousbeastie', I chanced upon a snickering cluster of Imps. Not to be confused with the pixie, these small, spiteful creatures are mischievous in the extreme and often waylay the unwary traveller, pushing and tripping them in a most unpleasant manner. As a well-seasoned traveller across this magnificent globe of ours, I, of course, am never 'unwary' and immediately upon spotting the snickering gang, I whipped out my trusty wand and cast a particularly well-aimed Flipendo Knockback Jinx at their cavorting leader. Before his gibbering cohorts could react, I then proceeded to grab the upended Imp by its slimy ankles (being careful not to besmirch my lime green robes) and threw it into the Clyde where it floundered most satisfyingly before dragging itself on to the opposite bank and fleeing in the direction of the nearby sewage works. Thus were the Imps defeated – the remaining band of jabbering pests running back to the filthy hole from whence they came.\nChapter III - A Frenzy of Furious Fire Crabs\n\nSubdue a Fire Crab by casting Flipendo then casting Incendio. I well recall the time when, on a peculiarly perspicacious journey into the heart of the Fijian rainforest, while engaged in a legendary odyssey to rescue the Giant Fire Crab from extinction at the hands of unscrupulous wizard poachers, I had occasion to rest a while in the shade of a banyan tree. While performing certain urgent ablutions, I was attacked by a veritable horde of furious fire crabs – these dastardly crustaceans obviously ignorant of the fact that I was endeavouring to save one of their kind from going the way of the dodo. Gracefully, I managed to dance away from the fearsome blasts of flame roaring from their posteriors and immediately whipped out my trusty wand. With several deft and delightful casts of the Knockback Jinx, the fire crabs were all flipped on to their backs, their pathetic legs waving uselessly in the foetid Fijian air. Leaving their exposed bellies to the burning rays of the searing Fijian sun, I went jauntily on my way – with an avowed intent to join the unscrupulous wizard poachers and assist them in wiping out every last trace of these cruel and savage crustaceans.\nChapter IV - Dire Dog Spirits\n\nGytrashes are only hurt by the light directed from a Lumos Spell. The black, vampire-infested forest of central Romania is not so bleak and forbidding a place than the twisted heart of the New Forest in Hampshire, England. It was here, several winters ago that I chanced upon two of the most dreadful creatures known to wizards and witches. I well remember the hour, late in the day, as I wandered gaily through the blighted woodland in search of the infamous Wild Ponies of that area. I entered a leafy glade, only to be confronted by a pair of prowling Gytrashes. These large dog-like spirits barred my way and so, whipping out my trusty wand, I cast Lumos to illuminate its tip, whereupon the Gytrashes retreated from the light and I was free to pass through the forest unmolested.

Its methods of killing are most wondrous, for aside from its deadly and venomous fangs, the Basilisk has a murderous stare, and all who are fixed with the beam of its eye shall suffer instant death. Spiders flee before the Basilisk, for it is their mortal enemy, and the Basilisk flees only from the crowing of the rooster, which is fatal to it.",
